Acest roadmap √Æ»õi oferƒÉ o direc»õie clarƒÉ! üöÄ DacƒÉ ai nevoie de resurse pentru fiecare etapƒÉ sau vrei sƒÉ-l ajustez, spune-mi! üòä

// plecam de la un console application
// scoate in class libraries
// introducem alte librarii
// unit testing
// access la baza de date
// serviciu rest
// si dupa design patters / arhitectura
// securitate performanta
//
